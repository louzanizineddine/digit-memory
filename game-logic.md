Idea behind this game
    ==> A number with only onde digit appears in the screen.
    ==> after some time the numbers disappears.
    ==> the user will try to write down what he saw.
    ==> the user has to write the number in a specific time.
    ==> the the answer is correct either we increment the number of digits or the speed of the number disappearing.

first Step:
    1. HTML Structure:
      1.1 => a section where the digits appears.
      1.2 => a section whre the user writes what he sees.
      1.3 => a sidebar containing all the numbers with a special bacground 'green or red'.
      1.4 => a section for the timer.
